### Consistent long-distance foraging flights across years and seasons at colony level in a Neotropical bat

The code presents the analysis workflow to test how Phyllostomus hastatus shows consistent foraging flights across years and colonies. The code requires personal login information for movebank and stadia maps.

The code follows as:

1. CleaningData_Bocas2021-2022_gh
2. CleaningData_2023_gh
3. CleaningData_2016_gh
4. Merge_alldata
5. Behavioral_classification
6. MainlandForaging_Figure1
7. Straightness
8. phyllostomus_appendix_stan_models.qmd
9. phyllostomus_appendix_simulations.qmd
10. Figure_1_gh
11. FigureS4_gh

Additionally this repository contains the appendixes of the stan models and the simulations used in this paper.

Colonies have been renamed in the code and in the manuscript as colonies 1, 2, and 3. Original names during the capturing/tagging process are:
- La Gruta = colony 1
- Aj cave = colony 2
- Muddy cave= colony 3
